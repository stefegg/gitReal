    <h1> Git Stash</h1>

    <a href="index.html" class="class">Home</a>
    <p> Git stash is a way to store teh changes that you've made on a branch without having to commit them or add them to a project that is being worked on. It's prefect for when you're in the middle of something and you want to switch to doing something else.</p>
    <strong>Hint:</strong> <p>If you see the following output when changing branches, you might want to consider using git stash. "Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches."</p>
    <p> To use stash, simply run:</p>
    <code>git stash</code>
    <p>You can view your stashed changes by running <code> git stash list </code> . This will show you a list of changes you have stored in the stash. </p>
    <p> You can apply any given stash to whichever part of your project you would like by running the following command: <br>
      <code> git stash apply stash@{#} </code>. # = the number that corresponds to the stash that you want to apply. <p>
